## 🔑 Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

### 4.1 Edit `.env` File

Open the `.env` file in your project root and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace with YOUR Supabase URL (from Step 2.4)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co

# Replace with YOUR Supabase anon key (from Step 2.4)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# Replace with YOUR Gemini API key (from Step 3.1)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
```

**Save the file!**

---

## 🏃 Step 5: Run the Development Server

Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
  ▲ Next.js 14.x.x
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Ready in 2.3s
```

---

## 🎉 Step 6: Test It Out!

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
2. You should see the LinkRay homepage
3. Try analyzing a URL like:
   - `https://github.com`
   - `https://wikipedia.org`
   - `https://example.com`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"

- Make sure you created the `.env` file
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Restart the dev server after editing `.env`

### "Failed to fetch website" or Timeout Errors

- Some websites block scrapers
- Try a different URL
- Check your internet connection

### Database Errors

- Make sure you ran the SQL schema in Supabase
- Check that your Supabase project is active
- Verify Row Level Security policies are created

### AI Analysis Errors

- Verify your Gemini API key is correct
- Check if you've hit the free tier limit (unlikely - it's generous)
- Try again in a few seconds

### Port 3000 Already in Use

Run on a different port:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

---

## 📊 Verify Database Setup

To check if your database is working:

1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Table Editor" in sidebar
3. You should see a `scans` table
4. After analyzing a URL in LinkRay, refresh the table - you should see a new row!

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Production (Optional)

### Deploy to Vercel (Free)

1. Push your code to GitHub (don't include `.env`!)
2. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Done! Your app is live 🎉
